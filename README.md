# React-Countdown

## What?

A React component that allows a countdown timer to be added to any react webpage.

## Why?

The timer allows users of a website to limit their use of the website. Examples of when this might be useful include work situations where motivation is a problem. At Founders and Coders we often have limited research time prior to discussion and a timer on a website could help.

## How to use

The component will be made available on NPM.

This code on github can be run locally with the command

```
npm run dev:start
```

## Dependencies

  babel-loader
  css-loader
  jsx-loader
  react
  react-dom
  style-loader
  webpack

## Dev-Dependencies

 react-hot-loader
webpack-dev-server
